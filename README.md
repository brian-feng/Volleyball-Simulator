# Volleyball Simulator
 
This is a simple Unity game simulating attacking in Volleyball. Use WASD and move your mouse to move. Press space to jump. Left click to swing. Note that swinging is only effective within a certain range of the ball. Press escape to return to the main menu. If the ball lands on the enemy side of the court, you get a point. If it doesn't, you lose a point. You cannot have negative points. You win if you reach 10 points!


To play, there is a pre-built Windows 10 build in the "Volleyball Simulator Build" folder. If you want to make your own build, you can open this repository in Unity 2023.25f1. Have fun!
